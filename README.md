# NSSF

Compliance of the 5G Network functions can be found at [5G Compliance](https://docs.sd-core.opennetworking.org/main/overview/3gpp-compliance-5g.html)

### Setting Up Polling

Include the `webuiUri` of the webconsole in the configuration file
```
configuration:
  ...
  webuiUri: https://webui:5001 # or http://webui:5001
  ...
```
The scheme (http:// or https://) must be explicitly specified. If no parameter is specified,
NSSF will use `http://webui:5001` by default.

### HTTPS Support

If the webconsole is served over HTTPS and uses a custom or self-signed certificate,
you must install the root CA certificate into the trust store of the NSSF environment.

Check the official guide for installing root CA certificates on Ubuntu:
[Install a Root CA Certificate in the Trust Store](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/how-to/security/install-a-root-ca-certificate-in-the-trust-store/index.html)
